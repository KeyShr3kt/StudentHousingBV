Introduction 

	You have successfully finished the semester 1 orientation phase and introduction project, in which 
	you have gained the basic knowledge of programming, designing interfaces, and other ICT related 
	subjects. For the profile phase you have chosen ICT & Software Engineering and we welcome you to 
	the ICT & Software Engineering profile! 
	In this phase, you will join a team to develop a project, which will be described in this document. 

Objective 

	You will form a team with two other students to work on a project for a simulated environment. The 
	objective is to determine what the problem is and how to remedy this with a software system.  

The simulated situation 

	We, Student Housing BV, own different building where students (our clients) can stay during their 
	study in the Netherlands. Our buildings are composed of rooms, which are rented by our clients, but 
	also shared facilities such as toilets, bathroom, kitchen, hallway, storage space, etc. 
	For some time now we are receiving complaints from our clients related to: 
	- Appointed persons not cleaning the shared facilities. 
	- Groceries are not done or paid for shared items such as toilet paper, dish soap, etc. 
	- Garbage disposal is not done on time. 
	- Unannounced parties, gatherings, etc. 
	These are only the complaints we have received and it would be realistic to assume minor issues 
	have not been communicated to us. 
	As an extra service, we want to offer our clients a software solution to better arrange day-to-day 
	situations and hopefully this will reduce the amount of issues they face. 
	We envision an application where our clients can record and see agreements made between them, 
	but also the possibility to see the house rules and to file complaints anonymously. Every so often we 
	will have one of our employees go by the buildings to update the rules and gather any complaints. 
	We encourage additional functionalities and suggestions as long as it does not endanger the delivery 
	of the application on time. 

Constraints

	For this project, all teams will have to keep to the following constraints: 
	- The programming language is C# and the main application must be a Windows Forms 
	Application; object-oriented programming must be applied for the application(s). 
	- Only theory covered during this semester is expected to be applied for the application(s). 
	- Information must be persisted in files, not in a database. 
	- If you later want to connect to a database, it must be done after having a good object-
	oriented level for the application data and after having implemented persistence in files. 
	- GitLab from Fontys ICT must be used for collaborating on the code base. 
	- Canvas must be used for determining and submitting the deliverables for the project. 
	- Weekly meetings must be scheduled with your assigned technical tutor to discuss the 
	progress of the project; presence of all members is required. 
	- Also, bi-weekly meetings must be scheduled with your assigned professional-skills tutor to 
	discuss the collaboration process; presence of all members is also required here. 
	- Agendas for meetings with the tutors must be delivered at the latest 24 hours before the 
	meeting; likewise, minutes of meetings must be delivered at the latest 24 hours after the 
	meeting. 

Way of working

	This project is performed with a group of three students. The tutors will guide you in the formation 
	of teams, which must be registered in Canvas. The tutors will send invitations for the first meeting, but
	for the rest of the project it is your responsibility to arrange the meetings. During these 
	meetings, you have the chance to inform your tutors about either your technical progress or the 
	collaboration process and, in all cases, discuss the challenges that you are currently facing. 
	The project will be performed in a sequential manner: 
	- Analyse the situation and propose a solution. 
	- Develop the solution. 
	- Deliver and present the solution.

Assessment

	At the end of this project, you have grown as a group and as individuals. This growth can be divided 
	into four categories; enumerated in an arbitrary order: 
	1. Documentation. 
	2. Implementation. 
	3. Project Management skills. 
	4. Professional collaboration. 
	The tutors of the project will give you frequent feedback on your performance in all these 
	categories. By the end of the profile phase, the project tutors together with the teachers of the 
	courses will assess you on these categories. In the end, they will decide together, based on both your 
	project performance and your performance on the courses, what the result is for the student on the 
	two learning outcomes of the profile phase: U(ndefined), O(rienting), B(eginning), P(roficient), 
	A(dvanced). For details, see Semester Guide. 

Expectations 

	The information about your performance that the assessors get from the project comes both from 
	the deliverables and from your professional skills; the latter often relates to how you collaborated 
	during the development of the project.  
	At the very least the following are expected: 
	- Project ownership pro-active attitude: It is expected that you take ownership of the project 
	and be pro-active. The work must be divided evenly between the members and, when 
	asked, should be made tangible and explicit. Note that dividing the work means all members 
	work on all the deliverables and you split it up on deliverable-level. 
	In addition, the project is open in what functionalities should be implemented (i.e. the case 
	only supplies a context). It is expected of you and your group to suggest, discuss and 
	implement additional features besides the ones mentioned in the simulated situation 
	description. 
	- Justifiable choices: During the project you will have to decide what and how you are going to 
	implement functionalities; these decisions should come from you or your group members 
	(see prior point). You should always be able to justify your choices in such a way that is 
	acceptable by your tutors. If you make assumptions for your decisions, always make sure 
	they are correct. 
	- Apply theory: It is expected that you apply the theory covered in the profile phase.
